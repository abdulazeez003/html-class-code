                  The land now called Abuja was originally the south-western part of the ancient Habe (Hausa) kingdom of Zazzau (Zaria). 
                  It was populated fore centuries by several semi-independent tribes.The largest of the tribes was Gbagyi (Gwari), 
                  followed by the Koro and a few other smaller tribes.
